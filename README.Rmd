# About

This repository maintains core workflows for accessing, processing, and mapping OISST data. For many of the global extent netcdf files processing will be done using python and xarray.

The processing and manipulation of tabular data and other files will be done using R and Rmarkdown for consistent reporting (and becauseI am much better with these tools)
